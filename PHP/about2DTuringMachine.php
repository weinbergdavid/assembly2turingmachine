                    2 Dimensional Turing Machine
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A Turing machine is a hypothetical device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On his article, Turing mentioned the fact that people perform their calculations on a 2-dimensional paper, and while doing so, on every given moment, focusing only on one position of the paper. Turing adds that the 2-dimensionality is not necessary, and a machine can do the same thing in a one dimensional strip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the fact that, as was proven by Turing, the one-dimensional machine is equivalent to the 2-dimensional machine, it is quite obvious that the 2-dimensional machine is much more intuitive, and calculations done by such a machine can be understood quire easily by human beings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Nachum Dershowitz and Dr. Gilles Dowek widely discussed this issue, and we decided to develop a web application which will demonstrate the machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After developing the application and writing numerous programs in it, we saw that it is quite difficult to write such programs, so we came up with the idea of writing a tool which will convert a program written in a 8086 assembly language into a two-dimensional representation of Harvard-architechture based computing machine.
